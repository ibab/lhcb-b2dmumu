  abstract = "The difference between two forms of likelihood approach is discussed, and their relative merits are described. The methods are illustrated by two examples: (1) estimating rates for forward or backward particles in an observed angular distribution; and (2) assigning tracks as pions or kaons using the information from a particle identifier. In the latter case, real data from decays of neutral charmed mesons are analysed by the two likelihood methods. "
