# Understanding the decay: Feynman diagrams

There seem to be 3 contributions to B→Dμμ:

- Effective vertex converting b→sμμ and exchanging W
- Attach photon decaying into μμ to any line of W exchange
- Charmonium pair from strong interaction after W exchange

Other similar decays:

- B+   → D+   μ μ
- B+   → D_s+ μ μ
- B_c+ → D+   μ μ
- B_c+ → D_s+ μ μ
- B_s0 → D0   μ μ

Looking at similar decays, B_c → D_s μ μ is interesting (it just has the effective vertex).
