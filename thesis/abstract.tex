\section*{Abstract}

An analysis of the decay $\PBzero\to\APDzero\APmuon\Pmuon$ using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \SI{3}{fb^{-1}} recorded with the LHCb detector is presented.
After an overview of the Standard Model of particle physics and an introduction to the decay $\PBzero\to\APDzero\APmuon\Pmuon$,
a description of the LHCb detector and the data acquisition process is given.
The selection procedure and statistical analysis of the data sample are described in detail.
Finally, an expected $90\%$ confidence limit of
\begin{equation*}
  \mathup{BR}(\PBzero\to\APDzero\APmuon\Pmuon) < 6.8^{+5.1}_{-2.9}\,10^{-8}
\end{equation*}
is predicted for this measurement.
