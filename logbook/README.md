# Chronological log

### 2014-10-31

- Started this chronological log.
- Familiarized myself with MC generation at LHCb using Gauss.
- Wrote a decfile for Bc+->Ds+MuMu.

### 2014-11-03

- Request for B->Dmumu Monte Carlo sent out.
 - They asked if we also want B+->D+mumu
- Sent a mail to LHCb Gauss Managers asking if my Bc->Dsmumu decfile is OK.
- Sketched out first steps of analysis:
 - Generate dataset from B->Xmumu stripping line.
 - Request Monte Carlo for interesting channels
 - Start training classifier with B->K\*mumu MC
