# B→Dμμ Analysis

This is the repository for my master's project at TU Dortmund.

During the course of my project, I will be looking for the rare decay B₀→D₀μμ and similar decays with [LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/) data.

Should the decay be found, a measurement of its branching fraction might be possible.

## Repository layout

The top level of the repository contains

 - The `cmtuser` directory containing customized LHCb software
 - The `setenv.sh` script that sets up the customized software when sourced
 - The `logbook` directory containing information on how the analysis was planned and performed
 - The `mc` directory containing configuration for performing Monte Carlo simulation of the analysed decays
 - The `data` directory containing configuration for fetching real and simulated data from the grid
