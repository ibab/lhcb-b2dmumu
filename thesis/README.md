TUDoThesis
=====================

LaTeX class file and template for a thesis written at TU Dortmund

The template is build for use with _lualatex_ and _biblatex_ with _biber_,
the class file can be used with the LaTeX engine of your choice, it is completely independent.

This is an unofficial document which was created from my bachelor thesis, which itself
was strongly influenced by the latex files which kdungs used for his bachelor's thesis.
