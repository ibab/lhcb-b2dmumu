\chapter{The Standard Model of particle physics}

The Standard Model of elementary particle physics \cite{Citation needed} is a \emph{quantum field theory} that provides a unified description of all currently known forms of matter and their interactions, with the exception of gravity.

The combined gauge symmetry group of the standard model is given by
\begin{equation}
  SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)\:,
\end{equation}
where $SU(3)$ represents quantum chromodynamics and $SU(2)\times U(1)$ represents the electroweak interaction.
