# B→Dμμ Analysis

This is the repository for my master's project at TU Dortmund.

During the course of my project, I will be looking for the rare decay B₀→D₀μμ and similar decays with [LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/) data.

Should the decay be found, a measurement of its branching fraction might be possible.
